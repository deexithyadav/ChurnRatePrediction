## Customer Churn Prediction

#### How to predict if a Customer will stay or leave the Bank? (Classification)
A source of 10,000 Bank records is tested using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and seven different Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether the customer leaves the bank or not. The algorithms include XG Boost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine.
